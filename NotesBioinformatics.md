### Difference between Ensembl Gene IDs and Entrez Gene IDs

Ensembl Gene IDs and Entrez Gene IDs are two commonly used gene identifier systems, but they are associated with different databases and have some key differences:

1. **Database Source**:
   - **Ensembl Gene ID**: Ensembl Gene IDs are provided by the Ensembl project, which is a comprehensive and widely used genome annotation database.
   - **Entrez Gene ID**: Entrez Gene IDs are provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as part of the Entrez Gene database.

2. **Scope**:
   - **Ensembl Gene ID**: Ensembl provides gene annotations for a wide range of species, including not only humans but also other animals, plants, and fungi.
   - **Entrez Gene ID**: Entrez Gene focuses primarily on gene annotations for various organisms, with a particular emphasis on human genes.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - **Ensembl Gene ID**: Ensembl Gene IDs are generally stable and unique within the Ensembl database for a specific species.
   - **Entrez Gene ID**: Entrez Gene IDs are unique within the Entrez Gene database but can sometimes be associated with different transcript variants of the same gene.

4. **Gene Models**:
   - **Ensembl Gene ID**: Ensembl often provides multiple transcript variants and alternative splicing information for a given gene.
   - **Entrez Gene ID**: Entrez Gene IDs provide a single identifier for a gene, but the database contains information on different transcripts, proteins, and variations.

5. **Annotations**:
   - **Ensembl Gene ID**: Ensembl offers comprehensive annotations, including genomic coordinates, transcripts, and protein products.
   - **Entrez Gene ID**: Entrez Gene provides detailed information on gene function, gene location, and associated publications.

6. **Integration with Other Resources**:
   - **Ensembl Gene ID**: Ensembl integrates data from various sources and provides a user-friendly interface for accessing genomic information.
   - **Entrez Gene ID**: Entrez Gene integrates information from NCBI resources, making it convenient for researchers who use NCBI databases such as PubMed, GenBank, and more.

Researchers often choose between Ensembl Gene IDs and Entrez Gene IDs based on their specific research needs, the organisms they are studying, and their preferred reference databases. In some cases, researchers may need to convert between these identifier systems to integrate data from different sources or databases.
