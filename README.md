## Introduction

In this repository, I have documented and organized my Bioinformatics research work from the very beginning of my research journey. Here, you will find valuable resources, datasets, and code for various aspects of Bioinformatics analysis.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a diverse set of resources and code related to Bioinformatics research, including:

- **RNA-seq Tutorials**: RNA-seq, or RNA sequencing, is a technique used to study gene expression at the transcriptome level. The RNA-seq tutorials provided here offer step-by-step guidance for analyzing RNA-seq data, from preprocessing to differential gene expression analysis.

- **Dataset Collection**: Access carefully curated datasets related to dengue and diabetes research. These datasets serve as the foundation for various analyses and experiments in the field of Bioinformatics.

- **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is the process of representing data graphically. You'll find code and scripts in this section for creating informative visualizations of your Bioinformatics data, enhancing data interpretation.

- **Quality Check**: Quality check procedures are essential to ensure the reliability of your data. Explore tools and techniques for performing quality control on your datasets, allowing you to identify and address potential issues.

- **CPM Normalization**: Count-per-million (CPM) normalization is a common method used in RNA-seq data analysis to account for differences in sequencing depth. Find code and explanations here on how to perform CPM normalization for your RNA-seq data.

- **DESeq2 Analysis**: DESeq2 is a popular R package for differential gene expression analysis. This section provides detailed code and workflows for conducting DESeq2 analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed under different conditions.

- **And More**: You'll discover many other resources and code snippets related to various Bioinformatics tasks and analyses.
