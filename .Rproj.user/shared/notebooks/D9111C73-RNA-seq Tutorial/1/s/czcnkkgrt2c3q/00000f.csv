ComplexHeatmap version 2.10.0
Bioconductor page: http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/
Github page: https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap
Documentation: http://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference

If you use it in published research, please cite:

  genomic data. Bioinformatics 2016.

The new InteractiveComplexHeatmap package can directly export static 
complex heatmaps into an interactive Shiny app with zero effort. Have a try!
